They provide their guests with many different amenities, transport and security options, convenient locations and affordable rates. Hostel Utopia aims to go above and beyond it's competitors in order to keep their existing customer base, and to attract new customers to it's services.
## Project Goal:  
To produce a simple and informative website for a global hostel chain, giving the user access to a home page with information on the company, a gallery of images with simple interaction, and another page with a validated contact form.

### Features

- __Navigation Bar__
    
    - the navigation bar is included on all pages and gives the user easy access to each of the three included pages

 This bar changes to social media links on the other pages for user convenience. There is a working, validated form which leads to a success page, and there is also a gallery, which can be clicked and interacted with on a basic level.
- Bugs:
There was a bug where the success page from the form would throw a 404 error. After much troubleshooting I realised that the action in the form was directed to "/success.html" and not "success.html".
