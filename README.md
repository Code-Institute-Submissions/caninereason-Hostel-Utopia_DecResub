# Hostel-Utopia
Project Goal: 
to produce a website for a global hostel chain, giving the user access to a home page with information on the company, a gallery of images, and another page
with a contact form.

Target audience:
the target audience will be backpackers and travellers who wish to avail of accomadation which offers many further amenities such as transport, tours and security.

Bugs:
There was a bug where the success page from the form would throw a 404 error. After much troubleshooting I realised that the action in the form was directed to "/success.html" and not "success.html".
