### Features
- There are three pages contained in the website, the landing page, a gallery, and a contact page. 

- __Navigation Bar__
    
    - the navigation bar is included on all pages and gives the user easy access to each of the three included pages. It will always remain on top of the page regardless of whether the user scrolls down.

- __Footer__

 - The links bar is situated at the bottom of the page and will either give users a convenient shortcut to information on the homepage, or links to social networks on other pages. It will always be fixed to the bottom of the page for ease of navigation.

- Bugs:
There was a bug where the success page from the form would throw a 404 error. After much troubleshooting I realised that the action in the form was directed to "/success.html" and not "success.html".
